## Administrative Namespacing

Originally, the API for the frontend of the website was namespaced under /admin. This made sense at the time, since there were no plain to build a CMS. When a CMS started to make sense, we went with ActiveAdmin and (you guessed it)... namespace collision. 

Everything required for the was re-namespaced under /json. You might find some remnants of the non-ActiveAdmin /admin namespace in the code (e.g. empty `admin` folders generated by Rails that were never deleted), but nothing is running under that namespace except the CMS.

## Deployment

precompile assets before pushing to Heroku
Heroku will serve static assets

## OUTSTANDING TODOS

- full automation of site setup using rails db:seed
- cleanup of unnecessary or outdated database columns
- understanding image hosting via Heroku and how to improve image load times
- fix issue with styles not loading on /admin
- property secrets management
- roll/update secret API keys for Sendgrid and Bucketeer
- confirm that email is still working
